# General Information
This repostiory contains the legacy code for the paper:

<strong>"BayesFlow: Learning complex stochastic models with invertible neural networks"</strong>

All examples and figures from the paper can be explored and recreated by running the corresponding notebooks.

Data for the seqRNA example is available on demand.

New examples and applications can apply the models by simply importing the ready-made models for and functions for online or offline learning. 

<strong>NOTE</strong>: A general and more modular version of the library has moved to https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow

## Requirements

We recommend donwloading the Anaconda distribution of Python and then installing TensorFlow:

    $ pip install tensorflow==1.13.1
